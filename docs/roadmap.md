# Roadmap and current status

Rewire is built incrementally. A phase is done when it is implemented, tested,
documented and demonstrable by a command. This page is the honest record of
what exists.

Legend: **done** · *in progress* · planned

| Phase | Capability | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | Project foundation: packaging, settings, logging, errors, preflight, CI | **done** |
| 1 | API change detection (OpenAPI diff, breaking-change classification) | planned |
| 2 | Repository analysis (AST index, symbols, imports, usages) | planned |
| 3 | Impact analysis (change × repo → ranked affected locations) | planned |
| 4 | First coding agent (tool-restricted, produces candidate patches only) | planned |
| 5 | Docker sandbox (isolated execution, resource limits, verification) | planned |
| 6 | Agent repair loop (sandbox feedback → bounded retries) | planned |
| 7 | End-to-end MVP (`rewire migrate`) | planned |
| 8 | Evaluation framework (datasets, metrics, published results) | planned |
| 9 | Model comparison across providers | planned |
| 10 | Agent ablations (AST vs text, repair on/off, context strategies) | planned |
| 11 | GitHub integration (branch, PR, never auto-merge) | planned |
| 12 | Automatic change monitoring | planned |
| 13 | HTTP API and background jobs | planned |
| 14 | Observability | planned |
| 15 | Web dashboard | planned |
| 16 | Security hardening review | planned |
| 17 | Performance and cost optimisation | planned |
| 18 | Portfolio and research write-up | planned |

Milestones: **0–3** core intelligence · **4–7** working agent · **8–10** measured
agent · **11–18** production product.

## What Phase 0 delivers

- Installable package (`rewire`) with a `rewire` console script.
- Typed, nested, environment-driven settings with secret redaction.
- Structured logging in human and JSON modes, with a redaction processor.
- A domain exception hierarchy carrying stable machine-readable codes.
- `rewire doctor`: executable preflight checks for Python, Git, the Docker
  daemon, ripgrep, LLM credentials and data-directory writability.
- `rewire config`: effective configuration with secrets redacted.
- pytest / Ruff / mypy-strict configuration, pre-commit hooks and GitHub
  Actions CI on Python 3.12 and 3.13.
- Dockerfile and Compose stack for reproducible development.

## What Phase 0 explicitly does not deliver

- No API spec parsing or diffing.
- No repository indexing, AST analysis or search.
- No LLM integration; `REWIRE_LLM__PROVIDER` defaults to `null` and the
  provider adapters do not exist yet.
- No sandbox. The settings block for it exists and is validated, but nothing
  reads it yet.
- No Git or GitHub operations, no HTTP API, no dashboard.
- No evaluation datasets or published metrics.

## Known technical debt carried out of Phase 0

- `Settings.database_url` defaults to a `sqlite+aiosqlite` URL, but no
  SQLAlchemy engine, models or migrations exist yet. The value is currently
  configuration-only and unvalidated against a live driver (Phase 13).
- `SandboxSettings` and `AgentSettings` are validated but unread; their defaults
  are informed guesses that Phase 5 and Phase 6 will have to justify with
  measurements.
- The `docker.sock` mount in `docker-compose.yml` is host-root-equivalent. It is
  acceptable for local development and is called out in ADR-003; Phase 16 must
  revisit it before anything resembling a deployment.
- The Docker image builds and its tests pass locally, but the image is not
  yet built or exercised in GitHub Actions CI.
- `docker compose run --rm rewire` relies on `group_add` to reach the Docker
  socket. The default gid 0 is correct for Docker Desktop; Linux hosts must
  set `DOCKER_GID`. This is documented but not auto-detected.
